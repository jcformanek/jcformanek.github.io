I am currently a machine learning researcher, doing work on offline multi-agent reinfocement learning. I am enrolled for a Ph.D. at the University of Cape Town,     with [A/Prof. Jonathan Shock](https://shocklab.net) as my supervisor. I am also a junior research engineer at [InstaDeep Ltd.](https://www.instadeep.com/) in Cape Town.

I am passionate about South Africa and Africa at large. I am driven to have a positive impact on the continent, particularly through outreach targeted at developing technology skills amongst the continents youth. I believe that if leveraged apropriatly, many technologies can have a transformative, positive impact on growth in Africa.

Despite the numerous potential benefits of new technologies, I am mindful of the potential risks certain technologies can pose if not deployed with careful consideration. In particuler, I am both excited and concerned by the transformative impact advanced Artificial Inteligence (AI) will have on Africa and the world at large. As such, I currently I am also working on AI Safety initiatives in Africa.
