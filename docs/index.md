I am a machine learning researcher, doing work on offline multi-agent reinfocement learning. I am enrolled for a PhD at the University of Cape Town, with [A/Prof. Jonathan Shock](https://shocklab.net) as my supervisor. I am also a junior research engineer at [InstaDeep Ltd.](https://www.instadeep.com/) in Cape Town.

I am passionate about South Africa and Africa at large. I am driven to have a positive impact on the continent, particularly through outreach targeted at developing technology skills amongst the continents youth. I believe that if leveraged apropriatly, many technologies can have a transformative, positive impact on growth in Africa.

Despite the numerous potential benefits of new technologies, I am mindful of the potential risks certain technologies can pose if not deployed with careful consideration. In particuler, I am both excited and concerned by the transformative impact advanced Artificial Inteligence (AI) will have on Africa and the world at large. As such, I also work on AI Safety initiatives in Africa.

# Experience

## 2023 to present | Junior Research Engineer | InstaDeep
I am a junior research engineer at InstaDeep. I write research papers on topics in machine learning and implement novel machine learning algorithms for research projects.

## 2021 - 2022 | Research Engineering Intern | InsataDeep
During my MSc and first year of PhD I was also working as a research engineering intern at InstaDeep.

# Education

## 2022 to present | PhD in Applied Mathematics | University of Cape Town
Enrolled for a PhD at the University of Cape Town. Thesis on offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. I am working towards training multi-agent reinforcement learning systems from offline human generated training data. 

## 2021 | MSc in Applied Mathematics | University of Cape Town
I enrolled for a research-based MSc in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town. My research was broadly on multi-agent reinforcement learning. During my research, I made some good progress on offline multi-agent reinforcement learning and together with my supervisore decided to upgrade my project to a PhD.

## 2020 | BSc Hons in Applied Computational Mathematics | University of Cape Town
I completed a BSc (Hons) in applied computational mathematics at the University of Cape Town. I did courses in graph theory, complexity theory, functional programming and reinforcement learning. My final project was on Graph Neural Networks.

## 2016 - 2019 | BSc Mathematics and Computer Science | University of Cape Town
I did my undergrad in mathematics and computer science at the University of Cape. During my undergrad in mathematics I tooks courses in advanced algebra, real- and complex analyis, and advanced calculus. In computer science I took courses in algorithms, data-structures, compilers, and networking.

## 2011 - 2015 | German High School in Johannesburg
I completed high school at the [German International School in Johannesburg](https://dsj.co.za/). I did all of my subjects in German until Grade 10, despite neither of my parents being fluent German speakers. In Grade 11 and 12 I switched to doing subject in English so that I could write the IEB matric exams in South Africa.

# Volunteering

## 2023 | Organising Comitee | IndabaX
I was on the local organising comitee for the 2023 edition of the [Deep Learning IndabaX](https://indabax.co.za/). I played a pivotal role in raising money for the event, coordinating local logistics and organising the hackathon.

## 2022 | Practical Comittee | Deep Learning Indaba
I organised the practial on reinforcement learning at the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2022/). I also organised a talk on AI Safety and Alignment at the event.

## 2022 | Built a Computer Lab | Bulungula College
A team of other volunteers and I built a low-cost computer lab at [Bulungula College](https://www.bulungulacollege.org/), a school in a very remote and rural part of South Africa. We came up with an innovative solution using Raspberry Pis and open-sourced our entire solution on our [website](https://bulungula-tech-centre.github.io/).
