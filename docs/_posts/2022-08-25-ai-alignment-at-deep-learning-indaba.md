The Deep Learning Indaba is the annual meeting of the African machine learning community with the mission to strengthen machine learning on the continent. I helped organise for a talk on AI Safety & Alignment to be put on the [program](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2022/indaba/programme/). I then planed and secured funding for [Fazl Barez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbarez/) to attend the conference to deliver a talk on AI Alignment.
