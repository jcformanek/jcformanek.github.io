One of the earliest pieces I wrote on AI Safety was a blog post I did at the end of the [AGI Safety Fundementals Fellowship](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/) at Camebridge. In the blog post, published on the [Effective Altruism Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/), I discuss the different classes of AI Risks I could imagine impacting Africa in the near future.
