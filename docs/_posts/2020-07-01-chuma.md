In an effort to help democratise the access to financial tools such as invoicing, inventory management and credit tracking we proposed a chatbot based application. Our goal was to build a service which informal traders could use to track their business finances. We thought a chatbot interface was the most apropriate for the context because many traders will have acceess to a smartphone running Whatsapp, it is intuitive and is not data-intensive.

We built out a prototype using the Telegram bot API and submitted our proposed solution to the Allan Gray Orbis Foundation's DigiJam 2020 Festival of Ideas. We were awarded the first place in the catagory of **Social Impact**.
