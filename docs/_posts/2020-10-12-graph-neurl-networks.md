## Abstract
This report was for submission for the applied mathematics Honours project at the University of Cape Town. 
Graph neural networks are a class of deep learning models which extend traditional deep neural network models, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, to non-Euclidean graph-structured data. 
Graph neural networks are designed to efficiently and adaptivly process highly complex graph structured data. 
Graph structured data is ubiquitous in many real-world domains, therefore it is of practical interest to develop deep learning models which can automatically extract useful features from such data. 
In this report I review some of the most important graph neural network models developed so far and consolidate several useful resources for implementing graph neural networks in practice.
