Off-the-Grid MARL is a framework for generating datasets and algorithms for offline multi-agent reinforcement learning that I developed. I generated more than 45 distinct datasets for researchers in the field to use, in the hope that it will drive progress in this nacent field. The datasets are freely available for download from the project website.

The corresponding paper was accepted as an extended abstract at [Autonimous Agents and Multiagent Systems](https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/) conference in 2023. The full manuscript is also available on ArXiv.
