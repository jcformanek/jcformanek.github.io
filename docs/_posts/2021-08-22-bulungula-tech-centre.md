For much of the first half of 2021 I was part of a team working on developing a low-cost computer lab for a school in a rural part of the Eastern Cape in South Africa. 

> The Bulungula Tech Centre was created as a model to bridge the technological gap in rural South Africa. Using cost-effective, energy-efficient and open-source technologies, the Bulungula Tech Centre provides access to computers and the internet for youth in five villages in the rural Eastern Cape. This website is a knowledge repository of how we set about creating the centre to help others replicate the process in their own communities.
