A paper I co-authored with [Callum Tilbury](https://callum.tilbury.co.za/) and others from InstaDeep and the University of Cape Town was accepted as one of five oral presentations at the [Reincarnating RL workshop](https://reincarnating-rl.github.io/) at [ICLR 2023](http://iclr.cc/). This was a massive achievement and was particularly exciting because it meant I got to travel to the conference, which was hosted in Rwanda.
