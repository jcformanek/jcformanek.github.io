As one of the developers of `Mava`, an open-source research framework, I helped facilitate a workshop on multi-agent reinforcement learning at the `Applied Machine Learning Days` conference.

For the workshop I prepared interactive Jupyter notebooks and did a code walk-through demonstrating how `Mava` can be applied to a real-world problem such as train scheduling. The notebooks I prepared are available on GitHub.
