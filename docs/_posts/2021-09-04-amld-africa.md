As one of the developers of [Mava](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava/), an open-source research framework, I helped facilitate a workshop on multi-agent reinforcement learning at the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-africa-2021) conference.

For the workshop I prepared interactive Jupyter notebooks and did a code walk-through demonstrating how [Mava](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava) can be applied to a real-world problem such as train scheduling. The notebooks I prepared are available on GitHub.
