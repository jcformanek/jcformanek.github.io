The Deep Learning Indaba is the annual meeting of the African machine learning community with the mission to strengthen machine learning on the continent. In 2022 the conference was in Tunisia and I was fortunate enough to get to attend. At the conference I gave a 2 hour long [practical](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2022/indaba/practicals/) on reinfocement learning. I am really proud of this innitiative as I hope to encourge more researchers from Africa to enter this field of research and hopefully develop transformative real-world applications of RL to tackle tough problems in Africa and beyond. The tutorial style notebook I prepared is available on the DLI's GitHub.
