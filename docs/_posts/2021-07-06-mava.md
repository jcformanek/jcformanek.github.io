As an intern at InstaDeep, I worked as a developer on the Mava project. [Mava](https://github.com/instadeepai/Mava) is an open-source research framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The code is available on GitHub and we published an accompanying paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01460.pdf).

We also have a blog post which covers all of the most important details about Mava.
